A csharp browser for <b>Windows</b>

Proudly made by the CollabVM and BetterVM community.

Current version: v0.2.1-beta

# Notes for current version
Since we were making this on CollabVM, someone ruined it, so we'll probably do it on BetterVM next time. We are currently working on a debian version of our browser, which will come out soon. So this version isn't entirely functional, the ... button does nothing for now, and new tab is just opening a new window.

Changelog:
- tabs (again, not functional)
- new ... button (going to be a menu for more controls)
- new icon (from iconarchive)
- changed title to beta 0.2.1
